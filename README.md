# Telegram Python console
You can use this bot to run a Python console from your Telegram!

## Setup
Just begin a chat with `@pythonConsole_bot` and you are all set.

## Features
  * History: the console remembers previous commands, and can fill the textbox with them. You can choose between two styles of history, ARROWS or LIST. The only difference is user interface. 
  * Traceback: if you want you can have the full traceback of errors printed, otherwise you just get a short error message.
  * Inspect: inspect the last variable using an interactive tool.
